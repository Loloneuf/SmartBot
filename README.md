# SmartBot
SmartBot is a relatively low cost robot that could realize actions based on a of using a simple data transfer mechanism  with an open code that will be easy to access and modify and without needing any external ressources but a smartphone.

This project aims to break the image of “inaccessibility” that is behind the concept of robotic initiation in order to improve and popularize the use of robotics in schools. Indeed, most commercialized robots capable of basic movements that are used for pedagogical purposes are really expensive and need both knowledge and installation of several softwares in order to access the robot’s control interface. 

## How does it work
The main idea is to have the robot functioning using a smartphone that display a web page producing light thus interacting with photosensors. This interaction will permit an easier color treatment via the phone camera as well as an almost instantaneous answer of our sensors. The code access is also facilitated by the use of a web page. It is also important to note that the smartphone's computational power allows for fast computations on the website.
Our robot won't need any supplementary configurations as everything is already within the website interface on the smartphone that will thus control our bot movements.

## Documentation
